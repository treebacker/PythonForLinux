Description: ### PythonForLinux
        PythonForLinux(PFL) is a base of code amied to make interaction with linux (on x86/x64) easier.
        Its goal is to offer abstractions around some of the OS features in a (I hope) pythonic way. 
        
        This project is inspired by [PythonForWindows](https://github.com/hakril/PythonForWindows) Project.
        At the same time, i want the project will help me(any one) learn linux internals more effectivelly.

        ### Overview
        
        
        #### Process / Threads
        PythonForLinux offers objecs around processes and allows you to:
        * Retrieve basic process informations (pid, name, ppid, bitness, ...)
        * Perform basic interprocess operation (allocation, create thread, read/write memory)
        * Explore the PCB (Process Context Block)
        * Execute `native` and `Python` code int the context of a process.
        
        I try my best to make th9oes features available for every creoss-bitness processes(32/64 in both ways).
        You can also makre some oeration on threads(suspend/resume/wait/get(or set) context / kill)
        
        ```py
        
        ```
